# `do` notation

* Let's write a program to dump a web page

~~~ {.haskell}
main = do
  (url:_) <- getArgs       -- Sets url to first command-line argument
  page <- simpleHttp url   -- Sets page to contents as a ByteString
  putStr (L.toString page) -- Converts ByteString to String and prints it
~~~

* This task requires some impure (non-functional) actions
    * Extracting command-line args, creating a TCP connection, writing
      to stdout
* A `do` block lets you sequence IO actions.  In a `do` block:
    * <span style="color:blue">*pat* `<-` *action*</span> - binds
      *pat* (variable or constructor pattern) to result of executing
      *action*
    * <span style="color:blue">`let` *pat* `=` *pure-value*</span> -
    binds *pat* to *pure-value* (no "`in` ..." required)
    * <span style="color:blue">*action*</span> - executes *action* and
      discards the result, or returns it if at end of block
* GHCI input is like `do` block (i.e., can use `<-`, need `let` for
  bindings)
* `do`/`let`/`case` won't parse after prefix function (so say
  "`func $ do` ...")

# What are the types of IO actions?

~~~~ {.haskell}
main :: IO ()
getArgs :: IO [String]
simpleHttp :: String -> IO L.ByteString -- (really more polymorphic)
putStr :: String -> IO ()
~~~~

* `IO` is a parameterized type (just as `Maybe` is parameterized)
    * "`IO [String]`" means IO action that produces a
      `[String]` if executed
    * Unlike `Maybe`, we won't use a constructor for `IO`, which is
      somewhat magic
* What if we try to print the first command-line argument as follows?

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    main = putStr (head getArgs)
    ~~~~

    * Oops, `head` expects type `[String]`, while `getArgs` is an `IO [String]`

* How to de-construct an `IO [String]` to get a `[String]`
    * We can't use `case`, because we don't have a constructor for
      `IO`... Besides, the order and number of deconstructions of
      something like `putStr` matters
    * That's the point of the `<-` operator in `do` blocks!


# Another way to see IO [[Peyton Jones]][Awkward]

~~~ {.haskell}
do page <- simpleHttp url
   putStr (L.toString page)
~~~

![](io1.svg)

* `simpleHttp` and `putStr` return `IO` *actions* that can change the
  world
    * Pure code can manipulate such actions, but can't actually
      execute them
    * Only the special `main` action is ever executed


# Another way to see IO [[Peyton Jones]][Awkward]

~~~ {.haskell}
do page <- simpleHttp url
   putStr (L.toString page)
~~~

![](io2.svg)

* The `do` block builds a compound action from other actions
    * It sequences how actions will be applied to the real world
    * When executed, applies `IO a` actions to the world,
      extracting values of type `a`
    * What action to execute next can depend on the value of the
      extracted `a`

# The `return` function

<!-- might need to check out
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/inkscape/+spec/allow-browser-resizing
-->

* Let's combine `simpleHttp` and `L.toString` into one function

    ![](simpleHttpStr.svg)

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    simpleHttpStr :: String -> IO String
    simpleHttpStr url = do
      page <- simpleHttp url
      return (L.toString page)  -- result of do block is last action
    ~~~~

* Note:  **`return` is not control flow statement**, just a function

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    return :: a -> IO a
    ~~~~

    * Every action in an `IO` do block must have type `IO a` for some
      `a`
    * `L.toString` returns a `String`, use `return` to make an `IO
      String`
    * In a `do` block, "`let x = e`" is like "`x <- return e`" (except
      recursive)


# Point-free IO composition

* Recall point-free function composition with "`.`" (fixity `infixr 9`)
* Function `>>=` (pronounced "bind") allows point-free IO composition

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    (>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b
    infixl 1 >>=
    ~~~~

* Let's re-write `urldump` in point-free style

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    main = getArgs >>= simpleHttpStr . head >>= putStr
    ~~~~

    * Note `>>=` composes left-to-right, while `.` goes right-to-left
* `do` blocks are just
  [syntactic sugar](http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch3.html#x8-470003.14)
  for calling `>>=`
    * Let's de-sugar our original `main`:

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    main =
        getArgs >>= \(url:_) ->
        simpleHttp url >>= \page ->
        putStr (L.toString page)
    ~~~~

# Lazy IO

* Some simple file IO functions may be handy for first lab

    ~~~~ {.haskell}
    type FilePath = String -- makes FilePath synonym for String
    getContents :: IO String          -- read all stdin
    readFile :: FilePath -> IO String -- read (whole) file
    writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO ()  -- write file
    ~~~~

* E.g., `main = readFile "input" >>= writeFile "output"`
    * Surprisingly, this program does not require unbounded memory
    * Rather, input is read lazily as the list of Characters is
      evaluated
* How lazy IO works
    * A list has two values, the head and the tail, each possibly a
      thunk
    * At some point evaluating thunk actually triggers file IO
    * Function `unsafeInterleaveIO` creates thunks that execute `IO`
      actions
      (c.f. more widely used `unsafePerformIO`, described in
      [[Peyton Jones]][Awkward])
    * Lazy IO is great for scripts, bad for servers; more in Iteratee
      lecture
