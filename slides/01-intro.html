<h1>What is Functional Programming?</h1>
<p>The <strong>key</strong> to understanding the definiton of functional programming is that FP is based on one constraint. Specifically, that when you call a function twice with the same input, it must return the same output both times.</p>
<p>Really?? An entire programming paradigm is built on that simple idea?</p>
<p><em>Really</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section slide level1" id="what-is-functional-programming-2">
<h1>What is Functional Programming</h1>
<p>From this single constraint, all other constraints follow.</p>
<p>Specifically, the requirement of &quot;same input, same output&quot; results in all the other distinctive qualities of functional programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions don't have side-effects</li>
<li>Every function’s output must only depend on its input.</li>
<li>No state changes</li>
<li>Data is immutable</li>

<li>If a function is called twice with the same parameters, it <em>must</em> return the same result.</li>
<li>This concept is known as <strong><em>Referential Transparency</em></strong></li>
<li>An expression is said to be <em>referentially transparent</em> if the expression can be replaced with its value without changing the behavior of a program (in other words, yielding a program that has the same effects and output on the same input.</li>

<h1>Examples of Referential Transparency (same input, same output)</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assignments are not transparent.</strong></li>
<li>For instance, the C expression <code>x = x + 1</code> changes the value assigned to the variable <code>x</code>. Let's say <code>x</code> is 5. Evaluating the expression once yields <code>6</code>. Evaluating the expression again yields <code>7</code>. And so, any assignment that changes the existing value is not referentiall transparent, because it is not free of side-effects. Here, the side effect is incrementing <code>x</code>.</li>

<p>No variable assignment?? But that's the bread and butter of imperative programming! How can we transform any data if we can't change state??</p>

<h1>Examples of Referential Transparency (same input, same output)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Yes, in functional programming, assignment is discouraged in favor of single assignment, also called initialization. Single assignment is an example of name binding and differs from assignment as described in this article in that it can only be done once, usually when the variable is created; no subsequent re-assignment is allowed. Once created by single assignment, named values are not variables but immutable objects.</p></li>
<li><p>For instance, calling a function such as <code>int plus_one(int x) {return x+1;}</code> is referentially transparent, as it will not implicitly change the input <code>x</code> and thus has no such side effects. When we call the function, we initialize the value of <code>x</code>, and it does not change. A new immutable value is the function output.</p></li>

<h2 id="lets-get-fundamental.-fp-abstracts-sequencing.">Let's get fundamental. FP abstracts sequencing.</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are two areas that are fundamental to programming a computer - <em>resource management</em> and <em>sequencing</em>.</li>
<li><em>Resource management</em> (allocating registers and memory) has been the target of vast abstraction, most new languages (imperative as well as functional) have implemented garbage collection to remove resource management from the problem, and lets the programmer focus on the algorithm instead of the book-keeping task of allocating memory.</li>
<li><em>Sequencing</em> has also undergone some abstraction, although not nearly to the same extent. Imperative languages have done so by introducing new keywords and standard libraries. For example, most imperative languages have special syntax for constructing several slightly different loops, you no longer have to do all the tasks of managing these loops yourself. But imperative languages are based upon the notion of sequencing - they can never escape it completely. The only way to raise the level of abstraction in the sequencing area for an imperative language is to introduce more keywords or standard functions, thus cluttering up the language. This close relationship between imperative languages and the task of sequencing commands for the processor to execute means that imperative languages can never rise above the task of sequencing, and as such can never reach the same level of abstraction that functional programming languages can.</li>
<li>In functinoal programming, the sequencing task is removed. You only care what the program is to compute not how or when it is computed.</li>

<h4 id="steeper-learning-curve.-functional-programming-can-be-a-mind-bender.">Steeper learning curve. Functional programming can be a mind-bender.</h4>
<p>For instance, let's write a function that pulls out every 3rd element of a list.</p>
<p>Imperative (in C)</p>
<pre><code>int counter = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size; i++) {
  if (counter % 3 == 0) 
     new_list.push(list[i])
}</code></pre>
<p>That's easy enough. Set a counter, move to the next element, increment the counter, check to see if you're at the Nth element and so on.</p>
<p>The functional equivalent is not so easy. We can't change the value of a counter, so we must keep track of where we are in the list by some changing input and output of a recursive call. Here we use a recursive call such that each time the call is run, the first n-1 elements are ignored, and the nth element is concatenated to the list.</p>
<p>Functional (in Haskell)</p>
<pre><code>every n xs = case drop (n-1) xs of
          (y:ys) -&gt; y : every n ys
          [] -&gt; []</code></pre>
<p>The latter method might seem more confusing, and that's because it is. Functional programming can be a mind-bender, which is one reason why Lisp, Scheme, and Haskell have never really surpassed C, C++, and Java in commercial popularity <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/602444/what-is-functional-declarative-and-imperative-programming">5</a></p>
<p>This example also demonstrates that many functional data structures are considered more difficult to design and implement than their imperative counterparts in large part because they are immutable. However, functional data structures can be as capable and asymptotically as fast as imperative data structures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section slide level1" id="downsides-of-functional-programming-1">
<h1>Downsides of Functional Programming</h1>
<h4 id="performance">Performance</h4>
<p>Imperative languages provide more intimate control over the exact way in which a computation is carried out (that is, until sufficiently smart compiler appears that is able to derive the C equivalent from the Haskell one-liner, all by itself. In fact, the gap in performance between functional languages and their more traditional cousins is narrowing. (okasaki Ch 1)</p>
<p>For example, in C, quicksort sorts the array in place. It uses no extra storage.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Haskell program allocates quite a lot of extra memory behind the scenes, and runs rather slower than the C program.</p>
<pre><code>// To sort array a[] of size n: qsort(a,0,n-1)

void qsort(int a[], int lo, int hi) 
{
int h, l, p, t;

if (lo &lt; hi) {
  l = lo;
  h = hi;
  p = a[hi];

  do {
    while ((l &lt; h) &amp;&amp; (a[l] &lt;= p)) 
        l = l+1;
    while ((h &gt; l) &amp;&amp; (a[h] &gt;= p))
        h = h-1;
    if (l &lt; h) {
        t = a[l];
        a[l] = a[h];
        a[h] = t;
    }
  } while (l &lt; h);

  a[hi] = a[l];
  a[l] = p;

  qsort( a, lo, l-1 );
  qsort( a, l+1, hi );
}</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<pre><code>quicksort :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
quicksort []     = []
quicksort (p:xs) = (quicksort lesser) ++ [p] ++ (quicksort greater)
  where
      lesser  = filter (&lt; p) xs
      greater = filter (&gt;= p) xs</code></pre>
<p>In applications where performance is required at any cost, or when the goal is detailed tuning of a low-level algorithm, an imperative language like C would probably the best choice.</p>

<h4 id="composability">Composability</h4>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Composing&quot; functions basically just means sticking two or more functions together to make a big function that combines their functionality in a useful way.</li>
<li>In functional programming, functional composition is essentially identical to functional composition in mathematics. If I have a function <code>f(x) = x^2</code> and <code>g(x) = x + 1</code>, composing the functions means creating a new function in which arguments are given to the inner function, and after the inner function computes the result, this output is given as the input to the outer function. Composing f outer with g inner could be written <code>f(g(x))</code>. If you provide a value of 1 for <code>x</code>, then <code>g(1) == 1 + 1 == 2</code>, so <code>f(g(1)) == f(2) == 2^2 == 4</code>.

<li>It's the ability to assemble complex behavior by aggregating simpler behavior</li>
<li>Something is <em>composable</em> when several instances can be combined in a certain way to produce the same type of thing.</li>
<li>Because functions in FP are dependent only on their input, and not any global state or side effect, subproblems can be solved independently with solving the other one.</li>
